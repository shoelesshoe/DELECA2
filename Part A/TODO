# DCGAN
remove dropout from disc
increase strides for disc
batchnorm for all except gen output and disc input
relu for gen, leakyrelu of 0.2 for disc
train with labels for images
train with real = fake, fake = real (flipped)

### GAN Model Evaluation Methods

There are several methods to evaluate the GAN. However, there are some issues with evaluating a GAN generator model.

1. There is no labels for GAN, the main focus is the quality of the synthetic data.
2. Different models have different objective functions

There are a few methods:

1. Manual GAN Evaluation
   - The simplest evaluation method is through visual evaluation using our eyes.
   - However, there are some issues:
     1. This method is very subjective and have some bias by the reviewer
     2. As the Cifar-10 images are only (32, 32, 3), it is hard to differentiate the classes and it is very small which is unclear
     3. If there is a large quantity of images generated, there is no way to go through each and every image to evaluate it
2. Qualitative GAN Evaluation
   - By identifying non numerical data in the images, we are able to use human subject evaluation or evaluation via comparison. Some techniques include using:
     1. Nearest Neighbors [Detect overfitting, generated samples are shown next to nearest neighbour in the training set]
     2. Rapid Scene Categorization [Get participants to help classify real and fake data]
3. Quantitative GAN Evaluation
   - Evaluating GAN on quantitative means refers to using a specific calculation of specific numerical scores, used to summarize the general quality of the images.
   - There are a few metrics:
     1. KL Divergence (aka relative entropy) [Measures the distance between two statistical probability]
     2. Fr√©chet Inception Distance [compares distribution of generated images]

For simplicity, we will be only evaluating the GAN models with manual and quantitative evaluation
